## Love Calculator

### Description
- Love Calculator allows you to see compatibilty percentages based on the name you choose to compare yourself with or if you want to compare two different names then you can also do that. We wanted to integrate a friendly UI component for the users to interacts with easily and for them to navigate through the pages in a non so difficult way. We also utilized the quotes API in order to give out some inspiration to the user once they are logged in to the application.
